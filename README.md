# thinkpadx201tScreenconfig
This creates a bash script for the thinkpad x201t  rotating the screen and adjusting the mouse for inverted screens
the x201t has a rotating screen i usually flip  the whole computer over but i'm just going to make it more convienant for me


I'm using i3 and mate so I'll also update the config for mate adding mapping to automatically rotate the screen

I'm just a hobbyist so the scripts aren't the best :)
